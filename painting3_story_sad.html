                <p>While the vibrant vermilion blooms of the 'Flame of the Forest' would have stood out against the dark greens of its home in the tropical forests of South-East Asia, in Australia, it was the showy lavender jacaranda that drew the most admiration.</p>
                <p>The jacaranda of Rivers's painting survived until 1979, when it was blown over in a storm. A solitary specimen of the 'Flame of the Forest' still blooms in the Brisbane Botanic Gardens, as it has done since it was painted by Rivers.</p>
