                <p>The scene is set at Ghost Gully, a small watercourse adjoining Whiskey Gully, the site of an old hotel south of Stanthorpe, 170 km southeast of Brisbane, Queensland. Folklore relates that Ghost Gully was so-called after miners who imbibed too freely at the Whiskey Gully hotel and then experienced the 'DTs' (delirium tremens) caused by alcohol withdrawal, which could bring on hallucinations.</p>
