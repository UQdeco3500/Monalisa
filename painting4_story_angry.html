                <p>Smart was forced by his financial situation to return to Australia in 1950. Australia in the 1950s, after almost two years spent in the bustle of Paris, must have seemed hauntingly desolate, and it was at this time that Smart developed his distinctive, slightly surreal view of the city as a desert of human emotions, which corresponds with the equally bleak and strange vision of the Australian outback which his friend Russell Drysdale was exploring at the same time.</p>
