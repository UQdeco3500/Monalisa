                <p>The painting An alien in Australia however was not as well received as Under the jacaranda. Hoping to capitalise public approval on Under the jacaranda 1903, the following year Rivers exhibited another portrait of an individual tree - the Butea. He received this piece of criticism:</p>
                <p><i>"...if [Rivers] had been content to take the tree and a small area of the trimly kept lawn, in the midst of which [the tree] throws its graceful shade, he would have produced a picture to which little exception could be taken, but the bandstand has also been introduced... The structure has a crowded look, and its presence detracts from the beauty of the picture."</i></p>
                <p>Rivers took this criticism to heart. Sometime after the painting was exhibited, he cut the painting down and reworked sections to remove all trace of the offending bandstand. The work remained in the collection of his widow, Selina Rivers, until 1941, when she presented it to the Queensland Art Gallery as An alien in Australia (the original title An alien in Queensland).</p>
