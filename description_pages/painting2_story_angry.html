                <p>Olley left Brisbane two years before the Queensland Art Gallery opened in 1982. Her family home 'Farndon' was destroyed by fire in 1980, and Olley moved back to Sydney permanently having already purchased a terrace house in Duxford St, Paddington in 1964 to stay when visiting and an adjacent former hat factory which she renovated to use as a studio. 1982 saw the passing of Olley's mother Grace, finally breaking the ties to Brisbane.</p>
