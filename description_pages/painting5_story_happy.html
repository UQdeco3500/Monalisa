                <p>Painted during the spring of 1935 not far from Rix Nicholas' new and spacious studio at Knockalong in southern New South Wales, The fair musterer is one of Rix Nicholas' largest and most important pictures. It marks the resumption of her professional career after the birth of her son in 1930. The model was Nance Edgley, her son's first governess who worked at Knockalong during 1934 and 1935. One of the artist's favourite views of the Tombong Range and the neighbouring property of Tombong can be seen in the distance. Exhibited in London in 1937 at the 'Artists of the British Empire Overseas' exhibition, The fair musterer was widely featured in the British press, where it was acclaimed as 'one of the outstanding pictures in the exhibition' and 'typically Australian in both subject and treatment'.</p>
