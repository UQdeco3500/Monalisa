                <p>Australian artist Jeffrey Smart (1921-2013) is one of Australia's most celebrated artists, seeking inspiration from the world around him.</p>
                <p>Smart portrays the sinister cheerfulness and bright sterility of a modern, progressive, industrial society with gem like clarity and precision. Early in his painting career he found a particular personal vision of the world and carefully refined this during his career.</p>
                <p>After 10 years in Australia Smart had achieved a national reputation as a leading, distinctly independent artist. His work was included in London exhibitions of Australian art in the early 1960s, when contemporary Australian painters were briefly enjoying enthusiastic attention from the English critics. By 1963 he was ready to return to Europe and live in Italy.</p>
