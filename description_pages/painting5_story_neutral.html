                <p>In the years following the First World War the bush ideal was enlarged and expanded by writers such as C E W Bean, who equated the digger's fighting prowess with the bushman's 'up country' life. When the nationalist rhetoric of the 1890s was reinterpreted in the context of the 'Anzac' experience, the bush acquired an even greater significance. As far as Rix Nicholas was concerned, however, a woman had as much right to paint the bush as a man. Gender barriers were irrelevant to her choice of subject matter. 'The work is the thing that matters', she proclaimed, not who does it'.</p>
                <p>Rix Nicholas wanted her pictures to valorise Australia and its unique way of life. The fact that rural Australia had become a highly significant cultural site painted by men did not deter her resolve.</p>
