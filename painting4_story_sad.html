                <p>It was in his home town of Adelaide that Smart first defined the kind of eerie emptiness and tedium that is depicted in his work. After years of living in Italy, the rather monochromatic Australian dustiness of Smart's early paintings was replaced by a clinically sharp focus and pure colour, yet the peculiar sense of unfulfilled listlessness of Sunday afternoons in Adelaide remained in his work.</p>
                <p>There is nothing about Smart's work (apart from the subject matter) that could be specifically associated with a particular place or country. As an international artist, he expresses something about the human condition which is universal, and paints locations such as airports, highways and housing estates, which are common to every industrialised society. This ambiguity of place, even a feeling of being lost, carries his work beyond social commentary to convey that particular mood of mysterious loneliness which writers like to describe as 'alienation'.</p>
