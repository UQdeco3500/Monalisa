                <p>In The reservoir, Centennial Park 1988 there is an underlying seriousness of purpose which is playfully counterpointed. The isolated figure which appeared in his paintings for decades is here, weighed down by a heavy bag and the immediate prospect of a further steep climb. The primary colours of her bag and the clothes of the runners who bound up the steps and stream along the crest of the embankment contrast with the severity of the environment. Particular elements and moods recur in Smart's works and here again a small discovered landscape of apartment buildings appear in the background.</p>
