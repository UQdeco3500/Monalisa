                <p>Back at the family home in 'Farndon', Brisbane no longer seemed quite as stifling. Towards the end of the 1950s Olley opened an antique shop at Stones Corner, an inner southern suburb of the city, and on the way to and home had to change trams. Olley reminisced...</p>
                <p><i>"I had to change trams at South Brisbane, which was very run-down in those days, full of depressed-looking hotels, real bloodhouses."</i></p>
                <p>Street in South Brisbane were demolished toward the end of 1966 to make way for the new and third Victoria Bridge, and those on the right from 1978 for the construction of the Cultural Centre's Performing Arts Complex.</p>
                <p>One can imagine Olley sketching these landmarks in South Brisbane while in transit, knowing of the impending demolition and bridge construction to come just months later. However, what Olley didn't know was just some years later, the area would be claimed for the future new premises of the Queensland Art Gallery.</p>
