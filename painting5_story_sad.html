                <p>Rix Nicholas' style was unusual in Australia between the wars; it was out of keeping with conventional artistic practice and challenged well-established ideas about the way rural Australia should be represented. The distinctive and unorthodox nature of her palette owed a great deal to the fashionable style of the French Salon prior to the First World War and singled out her pictures from those of her contemporaries such as Arthur Streeton and Hans Heysen, whose imagery popularly symbolised the nature of 'Australianness' during the 1920s and 1930s. Rix Nicholas' pictures referred to the same kinds of ideals and values, but her livelier painting methods meant that she represented the landscape differently, and in a way that was seen to be somewhat disconcerting.</p>
