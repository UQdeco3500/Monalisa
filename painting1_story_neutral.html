                <p>Rielly established his reputation in Victoria where he was a founding member of the Victorian Academy of Arts in 1870, exhibiting at the Academy and on its Council from 1875-84 before moving north. The Queensland Art Society was formed in 1887 and Rielly exhibited with the Society and acted as a Council member in 1894. He exhibited Ghost Gully evening at the Society the year it was executed and it is clear Rielly thought highly of the painting as he presented it to the fledgling Queensland (National) Art Gallery.</p>
